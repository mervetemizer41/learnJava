## Check if two words are anagrams using Java

This tutorial consists of 6 parts:

#### 1. Objectives
#### 2. Prerequisites
#### 3. Build Directory Structure
#### 4. Writing code in Java
#### 5. Compiling your code
#### 6. Running your code


## 1. Objectives

- Use StringBuilder and StringTokenizer
- Use command-line compilation with "javac" command
- Use command-line parameters with "java" command
- Use switch-case flow control structure
- Use a static method from a main method in a seperate class in a seperate file
- Compile and run the code in command-line on a Linux machine



## 2. Prerequisites


As hardware or software;
- A working computer with a Linux distribution on it
- An installed Open JDK or JDK which have version 8 or above
- A text editor


As skills;
- Basic file and directory navigation, generation and saving skill
- Basic skill to use a terminal on Linux machine



## 3. Build Directory Structure

Building the directory structure as following instructions:

Open terminal window, see the prompt like this:

> `<your name>@<your computer name>:~$`

direct to the path 

> `/home/<your name>/Documents/`

by

> `cd Documents`

command till you have a command prompt line like this:

> `<your name>@<your computer name>:~/Documents$`

Enter the lines:

> `mkdir learnJava`

> `mkdir learnJava/src`

> `cd learnJava/src`

See the prompt like this:

> `<your name>@<your computer name>:~/Documents/learnJava/src$`


## 4. Writing code in Java

As [AnagramChecker.java](https://github.com/mervetemizer41/learnJava/blob/main/src/com/challenge/beginner/AnagramChecker.java),

save the code using gedit or KWrite and save it with the definite file name with the appropriate file extension ".java".

As [Application.java](https://github.com/mervetemizer41/learnJava/blob/main/src/com/challenge/beginner/Application.java)

also save the code.


Save the code pieces above in two seperate files as `AnagramChecker.java` and `Application.java` in `src` Directory.

## 5. Compiling the code

> `javac -d ../classes ./*/*/*/*.java`

With your file explorer, navigate to the directory 

> `/home/<your name>/Documents/learnJava/classes`

see the directory structure:

> `/home/<your name>/Documents/learnJava/classes/com/challenge/beginner`

and class files like `Apllication.class` and `AnagramChecker.class`.

Then continue with next steps.

## 6. Running your code

While in terminal you see the command prompt line like below:

> <your name>@<your computer name>:~/Documents/learningJava$

enter below line:

> java Application a "new new new" "new"


That's where the log4j adventure starts.
