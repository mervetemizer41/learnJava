### Practice Maven

#### What I have done in general?
I added Zemberek library to my simple getting started maven project.

#### What is the aim?
Getting a working project which needs an external library. Main project should have been generated using mvn command and of course it should contain a pom.xml.
To be clear base project have to be a maven project. After that we call the libreries the external code projects as dependencies. Thus the dependecies should be added into the pom.xml within dependencies section.
